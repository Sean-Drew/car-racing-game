## General Features:

- The user can control the speed and direction of the player car. The player is able to drive offroad, but driving offroad results in a rapid deceleration. 

- The player has a "dashboard UI" to display the current speed, score and remaining lives.

- Crashing into an NPC car results in losing a player life. If all lives are lost, the game ends.

- NPC cars move at varying speeds and in varying road spaces. NPC cars tend to avoid colliding with each other and may move around the road to do this. NPC cars spawn with randomly assigned colors to differentiate from the player car.
